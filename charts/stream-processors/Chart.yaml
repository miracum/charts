        ⚠️ BREAKING CHANGE: Changed the configuration for metrics and service ports, allowing more flexibility.
        Port 8080 is no longer exposed by default if `metrics.enabled=true`. Instead, a new `stream-processors.*.container.ports`
        array field is added and all ports under `.container.ports` are exposed as a service by default.
        `metrics.serviceMonitor.endpoints` must now be explicitly defined to expose the metrics endpoint.
